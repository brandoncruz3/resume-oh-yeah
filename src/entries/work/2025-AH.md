• Architected a GitOps-driven platform using ArgoCD on AWS EKS to support scalable, declarative deployments across all environments.
• Developed self-service CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Docker, enabling faster, secure deployment via AWS ECR.
• Authored reusable Terraform modules for multi-tenant infrastructure provisioning (EKS, IAM, RDS, S3, security groups).
